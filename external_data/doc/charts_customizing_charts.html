    You can customize any chart according to your needs with the <a
        href="http://www.sqlmaestro.com/products/mysql/phpgenerator/help/01_03_09_chart_advanced_options/"
        target="_blank">OnPrepareChart</a> event.
    It is possible to use all the possibilities provided by the <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/"
                                                                   target="_blank">Google Chart Library</a>.

    In the example below two charts are based on exactly the same settings. The first chart is kept in the default
    state while the second chart has been customized with a few lines of <a href="#" class="detailed-description">code</a>.
