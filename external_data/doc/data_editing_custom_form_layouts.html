    PHP Generator allows you to customize layouts for Edit, Insert, View and <a href="data_editing_multi_edit.php">Multi-Edit</a> forms with just a few lines of code. All you need to customize the layout for a form is to define the appropriate
    <a href="http://www.sqlmaestro.com/products/mysql/phpgenerator/help/01_03_04_31_on_get_column_form_layout/" target="_blank">OnGetCustomFormLayout</a> event handler.

    You can group related input controls in a form as well as manage the location of the controls within the groups.
    Both horizontal and vertical forms are supported as well as all the editing modes
    (<a href="data_editing_separate_page.php">separate page</a>, <a href="data_editing_modal_window.php">modal window</a>,
    and <a href="data_editing_inline_editing.php">inline editing</a>).

        to see the customized template in action. Click the
    <span><i class="icon-question"></i></span> button to get familiar with the <a href="#" class="detailed-description">event handler code</a>.
