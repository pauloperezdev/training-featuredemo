<p>
    When a desired item is missing in a lookup editor, there is no more need to return back to the appropriate page,
    create the item and repeat everything from the beginning: just press the <span><i class="icon-plus"></i></span> button
    on the right of the editor and create the item directly in the popup modal window. Nesting depth is unlimited
    i.e. you can create a new element for a lookup editor in the modal window mentioned above, and so on.

    To see this feature in action, open <a href="?operation=insert">Insert</a> or <a href="?operation=edit&pk0=1">Edit</a>
    form, and take a look at the <span class="identifier">Country</span> lookup editor.
