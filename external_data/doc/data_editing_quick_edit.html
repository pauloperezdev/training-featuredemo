    To help increase editing speed, a new data editing tool has been implemented. You can now change the value of a grid cell even without having to go to an Edit form:
    just move the mouse pointer to the upper right corner of the cell and click the <span clas="icon-edit pgui-cell-edit-button"><i class="icon-edit"></i></span> pencil icon.
    This will display a single-editor form with the value stored in the database.
</p>

    Now you can modify the value and click Save to save the changes or click Cancel (or anywhere outside the form) to discard the changes and exit from the Quick Edit mode.
