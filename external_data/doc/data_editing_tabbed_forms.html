    It is possible to organize content of long <a href="#" class="description-insert">Insert</a>, <a href="#" class="description-edit">Edit</a> and
    <a href="#" class="description-view">View</a> forms more effectively using tabs.
    Tabs provide an easy and powerful mechanism to handle huge amount of content within a small area
    through separating content into different sheets. Only one sheet can be seen at a time.

<p>
    Use the <a href="http://www.sqlmaestro.com/products/mysql/phpgenerator/help/01_03_04_31_on_get_column_form_layout/"
                   target="_blank">OnGetCustomFormLayout</a> event to enable tabs on a form and to distribute related input controls in the appropriate tab sheets.
    Five different tab styles are supported. Each of <a href="#" class="description-insert">Insert</a>,
    <a href="#" class="description-edit">Edit</a> and <a href="#" class="description-view">View</a> forms in this example uses its own tab style.
</p>
<p>
    The layout of each tab sheet <a href="data_editing_custom_form_layouts.php">can be customized</a> just like a layout of a simple (non tabbed) form.
    Click the <span><i class="icon-question"></i></span> button to see how tabbed forms implemented for the example below.
