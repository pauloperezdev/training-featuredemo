<p> PHP Generator provides support for both control level and form level client-side data validation. Control level
    validation means that data are verified after a user enters a value into a form field and moves onto the next field on the
    form. On using the form-level validation the data are verified after the user enters (correct) values into all the fields and
    submits the form.
</p>
<p>
    For control-level validation you can bind one or more of predefined validators like Data Length, Data Range, Email,
    URL, Credit Card, Regular Expression, etc. to a form field directly in the software UI. To implement form-level validation, you need to
    provide <a href="http://www.sqlmaestro.com/products/mysql/phpgenerator/help/01_03_04_03_insert_form_validate/" target="_blank">OnInsertFormValidate</a>
    and/or  <a href="http://www.sqlmaestro.com/products/mysql/phpgenerator/help/01_03_04_04_edit_form_validate/" target="_blank">OnEditFormValidate</a>
    event handlers.

<p>
    The example below learns how to implement control-level validation based on a regular expression
    (the value of the <span class="identifier">Name</span> field should start with a capital letter), and
    form-level validation (values of <span class="identifier">Name</span>  and <span class="identifier">Last Name</span>
    fields must be different). Open <a href="?operation=insert">Insert</a> or <a href="?operation=edit&pk0=1">Edit</a> forms to see this in action.
