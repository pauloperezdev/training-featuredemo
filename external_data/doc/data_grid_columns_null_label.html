    It is possible to define a custom character string that will be displayed when a <i>NULL</i> value is stored in the database.
    For example, you can use something like "Not selected", "Not available", "Not supported", etc.

    In the example below the value of the Null Label property for the <span class="identifier">Audio sample</span> column is set to <i>(no audio)</i>.
