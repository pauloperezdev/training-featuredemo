    You can compare multiple records and find the differences between their values with a few mouse clicks. Just select
    two or more records (the selection management button will appear), then choose &quot;Compare&quot; from the
    button's drop down menu. Lazy users can simply click one of ready-to-use links below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="?operation=compare&keys[0][0]=19&keys[1][0]=20&keys[2][0]=21&keys[3][0]=22">Compare iPhones 12 series</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="?operation=compare&keys[0][0]=22&keys[1][0]=17&keys[2][0]=14">Compare latest top of the line iPhones</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="?operation=compare&keys[0][0]=19&keys[1][0]=18&keys[2][0]=8&keys[3][0]=6&keys[4][0]=5">Compare compact iPhones</a>
    </li>
</ul>

    By default, values are compared with the == operator. You can also
    <a href="http://www.sqlmaestro.com/products/mysql/phpgenerator/help/01_03_04_33_on_get_custom_compare_values/" target="_blank">define your own function</a>
    that compares the values with the algorithm you provided. For example, you can implement a case-insensitive comparison or consider
    two values equal if their difference is less than a predefined value. Click the <span><i class="icon-question"></i></span>
    button to see how such a function has been implemented for the page below.
