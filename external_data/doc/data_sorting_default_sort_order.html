    It is also possible to specify the default sort order for a page. In the example below data are sorted by the
    <span class="identifier">Continent</span> column in ascending order,
    then by the <span class="identifier">Population</span> column in descending order.
</p>

    Note that removing all columns from the sort order will restore the default ordering.
