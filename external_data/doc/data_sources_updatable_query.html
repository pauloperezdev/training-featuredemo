    Updatable queries allow you to create pages with quite complex business logic. For example, you can insert or update records in multiple
    tables simultaneously transparently for a user, who just fills an Insert/Edit form and presses Submit. To make a query updatable,
    it is necessary to provide INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements that are executed when a record inserted, updated, and deleted accordingly.

    to learn how to write such statements.
