    Starting from <a href="https://www.sqlmaestro.com/news/company/php_generators_18_3_released/" target="_blank">version 18.3</a>
    you can make a read-only view updatable using the same technique as for <a href="data_sources_updatable_query.php">updatable queries</a>
    i.e. providing INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements that are executed when a record inserted, updated, and deleted accordingly.
