    Use a view as a page data source is almost as easy as a <a href="data_sources_table.php">table</a>. The only difference
    is that you should provide key columns for a view <a href="https://www.sqlmaestro.com/products/mysql/phpgenerator/help/01_02_00_select_datasources/" target="_blank">directly in PHP Generator</a>,
    not in the database as for a table. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_view">Materialized views</a> also can be used as page data source in DBMS where they are supported (like
    <a href="https://www.sqlmaestro.com/products/postgresql/phpgenerator/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> or <a href="https://www.sqlmaestro.com/products/oracle/phpgenerator/" target="_blank">Oracle</a>).
