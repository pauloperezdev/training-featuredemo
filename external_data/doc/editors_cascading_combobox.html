<p>
    Cascading Combobox is a series of 2 or more <a href="editors_combobox.php">comboboxes</a> in which each combobox is filtered according to
    the selection in the upper combobox. Select this editor to get greater control over data input and to make things easier for the user.
    The number of levels is not limited.
</p>
<p>
    In Cascading Combobox items in all levels are filled once the data input form is loaded. If all or any of the levels can contain a sufficiently large number of items,
    consider to use the <a href="editors_dynamic_cascading_combobox.php">Dynamic Cascading Combobox</a> editor instead.

    Open <a href="#" class="description-insert">Insert</a> or <a href="#" class="description-edit">Edit</a> forms to see the editor in action.
