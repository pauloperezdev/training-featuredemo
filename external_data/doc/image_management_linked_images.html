    This feature is an alternative way for displaying <a href="index.php?group=Master-Detail+Views">master/detail</a> data when the detail data
    source stores filenames for external images (for example, the master table stores information about photo albums while the detail table stores
    information about album photos). These images are displayed in the popup window when you click a cell in a grid column linked images are associated with.
    You can also select number of images to be previewed in the <a href="?operation=view&pk0=1">View form</a>.

    Click any album title or album cover to display the photos of that album. Note that you can also
    <a href="image_management_multi_upload2.php">upload multiple images</a> at a time.
