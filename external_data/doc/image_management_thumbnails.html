    Thumbnails are reduced-size versions of pictures that help you to save a lot of web traffic. When a user opens a page,
    only thumbnails are loaded from the web server. A real full size picture is loaded only when/if the user clicks on a thumbnail.

    Click an image in the <span class="identifier">Thumbnail</span> column to see the corresponding full size picture.
