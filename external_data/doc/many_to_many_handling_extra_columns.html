    Sometimes the <a href="many_to_many_classic_junction_table.php">junction table</a> contains extra columns
    (assume that have people and companies, and those people can work at one or more companies. We want to know
    when a person started working at a company and what his/her salary is). The best way to handle this case is to use
    a master-detail interface. A detailed guide can be found in
    <a href="http://www.sqlmaestro.com/products/mysql/phpgenerator/resources/how_to_handle_many_to_many_relationships/"
