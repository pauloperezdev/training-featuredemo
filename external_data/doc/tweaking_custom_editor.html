    You can use any third-party edit control available as jQuery plugin in data input forms. Typically all you need is to
    write a small function in JavaScript that initializes the editor and call this function from
    <a href="http://www.sqlmaestro.com/products/mysql/phpgenerator/help/01_03_04_07_insert_form_loaded/" target="_blank">OnInsertFormLoaded</a>
    and
    <a href="http://www.sqlmaestro.com/products/mysql/phpgenerator/help/01_03_04_08_edit_form_loaded/" target="_blank">OnEditFormLoaded</a>
     event handlers.

    The page below allows you to edit the contents of the <span class="identifier">function_code</span> field using the
    <a href="https://codemirror.net/" target="_blank">CodeMirror editor</a> that provides syntax highlighting, code folding,
    autocompletion, and other useful features. Open <a href="?operation=insert">Insert</a> or <a href="?operation=edit&pk0=1">Edit</a>
    forms to see the editor in action.
