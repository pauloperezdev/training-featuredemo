    You can easily change default icons used in the application to your owns.
    All you need is to create or find somewhere a suitable icon set and point your application to use these icons via
    <a href="http://www.sqlmaestro.com/products/mysql/phpgenerator/help/01_04_03_custom_css/" target="_blank">user-defined styles</a>.
    It is possible to use separate images as well as image sprites.
