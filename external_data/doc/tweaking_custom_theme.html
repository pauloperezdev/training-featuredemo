    You can <a href="http://www.sqlmaestro.com/products/mysql/phpgenerator/help/01_04_02_color_scheme/" target="_blank">customize any color theme</a>
    that <a href="color_themes.php">comes with PHP Generator</a> adding or changing just a few lines of code. The theme created for the page below is based on the standard
    <span class="identifier">Facebook</span> theme and is used in our <a href="http://demo.sqlmaestro.com/mysql_schema_browser/" target="_blank">MySQL Schema Browser</a> demo
    to make it look like one of the previous versions of MySQL.com website.
